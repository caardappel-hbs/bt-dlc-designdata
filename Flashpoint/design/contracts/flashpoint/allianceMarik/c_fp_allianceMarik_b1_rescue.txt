// Difficulty is one of Easy, Medium, or Hard
[Difficulty]Hard
[ShortDesc]Our operative, Jawad, is in deep cover at the naval logistics base on this tiny island, Commander. Once you arrive at the facility, he'll break cover and board your unit in the rumble seat. Then you just need to get him and the data he carries out of the facility. We'll have the Leopard on standby to pick you up. We're going in loud, Commander, which means the facility is going to know you're coming. Be prepared for heavy resistance.
[LongDesc]I doubt they'll have been able to get more than a single backup lance over to this remote island in the time they'll have before we show up, guns blazing.
