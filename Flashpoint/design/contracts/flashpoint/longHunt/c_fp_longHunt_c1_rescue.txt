[Template]Rescue

// Difficulty is one of Easy, Medium, or Hard
[Difficulty]Easy
[ShortDesc]Colonel Lees's stronghold is just ahead of you, Commander. For all his arrogant bluster, it would seem that the Butcher of Shaul Khala is a coward at heart. I've seen no sign that he intends to meet you on the field of battle. So be it; if he won't leave his fortress voluntarily, then I will have your BattleMechs remove him by force.
[LongDesc]We've got Lees backed into a corner. Time to finish the job.

	[Content]This is it, Commander. My agents tell me that the Butcher of Shaul Khala is sheltering in a disused tower just ahead of you. Apparently, he'd rather hide in his command center than face you directly.
